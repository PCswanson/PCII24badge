# PC Innovation Insitute 24 Badge
 Base files and instructions for using and hacking this year's Innovation Institute Badge

## Using the Badge "As-is"
Along with your name, school, and position, your badge comes with a few built in apps which give you helpful information for the Innovation Institute.
1. To use the screen and built in apps, you must first power up your badge. You can do so by either plugging your badge into a laptop or charger using a standard USBC cable, or you can use the battery pack supplied in your conference bag. Be sure to turn the batter pack's power on!
2. To access the app menu screen, press the "A" and "C" buttons on the bottom of the badge at the same time.
3. Once in the menu, you can change pages and find more apps with the up and down buttons on the right side of the badge, and select an app with the corresponding buttons on the bottom of the badge.
4. To return the badge to it's original screen, just select the "Badge" app.
